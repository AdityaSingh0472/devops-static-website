# DevOps Static Website — CI/CD Pipeline (by Aditya Singh)

This project demonstrates a simple Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **GitHub**.

---

## 📘 About the Project

This is part of my **B.Tech (Cloud Technology and Information Security)** coursework.  
It’s a simple static website built using HTML and CSS, automated using Jenkins and Docker.

Whenever I push code to GitHub:
1. Jenkins automatically pulls the latest code.
2. Jenkins builds a new Docker image.
3. Jenkins runs a new container hosting the website.

Result → The updated website is available on `http://localhost:8080`.
